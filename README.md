THE PROGRAM:

The program is a rudimentary bookingsystem. It consists of 2 "screens": 
1) one with 6 empty rectangles (representing movieposters) and 6 "Book Tickets"-buttons (one button underneath each poster)
2) one with rows and collumns of white squares (representing seats in a movie theater) and a red "Back"-button

When the program is opened, screen 1 - the screen with movieposters - is displayed 

In screen 1:
- If you press a "Book Ticket"-button in screen 1 screen 2 - the movie theater - is displayed * 

In screen 2: 
- If the mouse is hovering over one of the squares representing seats in a movie theater, this square is colored green (as long as the mouse is hovering over this the square) 
- If the mouse is hovering over one of the squares AND the mouse is clicked, the sqaure changes its permanent color from white to blue (representing a booked seat)
- If the mouse is hovering over one of the squares which is "booked", the sqaure is colored yellow (as long as the mouse is hovering over this the square) 
- If the mouse is hovering over one of the squares which is "booked" AND the mouse is clicked, the sqaure changes its permanent color back to white
- If you press the "Back"-button, screen 1 is displayed. 


That's it. 


*Unless you press the "Book Tickets"-button in the bottom right corner. This "Book Tickets"-button is placed more or less at the same coordinates as the "Back"-button in screen 2. So when you press the "Book Tickets"-button you press the "Back"-button, so that screen 2 is never displayed) 
Also: If you press the "Book Tickets"-buttons in the top left corner or the one in the top center of screen, you book a seat in screen 2.
